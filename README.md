1. Raw Dataset Analysis
2. Datasets Cleaning:
                    >> K-NN (3,5,7,9,11) Imputer is used to impute the missing data in the datasets.
                    >> Mean Imputation is also applied in the dataset.
3. Applied 6 models before any feature extractions.
                    >> Models (Logistic-Regression, Random Forest, SVM, K-NN Naive Bayes, FNN)
4. Feature selection Using Random Forest with 500 n_estimators(trees).
5. Again Applied all 6 models and also **One Combined Model of logistic Regression and Random Forest.**
